# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

## Introduction
This project aims to build a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes. The dataset used is provided by BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider.

## Dataset
The dataset (`day.csv`) contains daily bike rental counts along with various features such as temperature, humidity, season, and weather conditions.

## Objective
1. Identify significant variables in predicting bike demand.
2. Understand how these variables influence the demand.

## Steps
1. Data preparation and cleaning.
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
3. Model building and evaluation.
4. Interpretation of results.

## Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the R-squared score on the test set.

## Results
The final model provides insights into significant factors affecting bike demand, which can help BoomBikes in strategic decision-making.
